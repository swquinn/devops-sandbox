Vagrant Case Study
==================

This case study works with a very simple `Vagrantfile` that uses the `precise32` VM provided by Vagrant to boot up a VirtualBox VM using the VirtualBox GUI. The memory on the machine is modified from the base memory to `1024MB` of RAM.

Getting Started
---------------

  1. Open a command prompt to the case study.
  2. Issue the command

     `$ vagrant up`
