Vagrant Case Study
==================

This case study works with a very simple `Vagrantfile` that uses the `precise32` VM provided by Vagrant to boot up a headless server with no configuration beyond what is already on the VM.

Getting Started
---------------

  1. Open a command prompt to the case study.
  2. Issue the command

     `$ vagrant up`
